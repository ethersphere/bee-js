## Install

### npm

```sh
> npm install @ethersphere/bee-js --save
```

### Use in Node.js

```js
var BeeJs = require("@ethersphere/bee-js");
```

### Use in a browser with browserify, webpack or any other bundler

### Use in a browser Using a script tag

Loading this module through a script tag will make the `BeeJs` object available in the global namespace.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@ethersphere/bee-js/dist/index.browser.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
import { Bee } from "@ethersphere/bee-js"; // Connect to a node const

bee = new Bee("http://localhost:1633");

const fileHash = await bee.uploadData("Bee is awesome!");
const retrievedData = await bee.downloadData(fileHash);

console.log(retrievedData.toString()); // prints 'Bee is awesome!'
```

## Documentation

You can find the full documentation [here](https://bee-js.ethswarm.org/docs). The API reference documentation can be found [here](https://bee-js.ethswarm.org/docs/api-reference).

You can generate API docs locally with:

```sh
npm run docs
```

The generated docs can be viewed in browser by opening `./docs/index.html`

## Contribute

There are some ways you can make this module better:

- Consult our [open issues](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-js/issues) and take on one of them
- Help our tests reach 100% coverage!
- Join us in our [Mattermost chat](https://beehive.ethswarm.org/swarm/channels/swarm-javascript) if you have questions or want to give feedback

### Setup

Install project dependencies with

```sh
npm i
```

### Test

The tests run in both context: node and dom with Jest.

To run the test, you need to have a Bee cluster running locally. To create a cluster, please consult the readme of [@ethersphere/bee-local](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee-local).

By default, tests are run against local bee node 0 - `http://bee-0.localhost`. You can change it by setting environment variable `BEE_API_URL`.
In order to run tests which require one more node, you need to define `BEE_PEER_API_URL` as well. Its default value `http://bee-1.localhost`

In Visual Studio environment, the tests have been set up to run against your local bee node on `http://localhost:1633`
To run Jest tests, choose the `vscode-jest-tests` CI job under the Run tab.
You can run your own local Bee client for test purposes with the help of [test/bee.sh](test/bee.sh).
If you pass `--ephemeral` flag, the container automatically will be removed at the end of the run.

There are also browser tests by Puppeteer, which also provide integrity testing.
```sh
npm run test:browser
```
The test HTML file which Puppeteer uses is the [test/testpage/testpage.html](test/testpage/testpage.html).
To open and manually test BeeJS with developer console, it is necessary to build the library first with `npm run compile:browser` (running the browser tests `npm run test:browser` also builds the library).

### Compile code

In order to compile NodeJS code run

`npm run compile:node`

or for Browsers

`npm run compile:browser`
